--- mångata WEB ---

# 1.Intro #

    -Mångata WEB is a sample (maybe fancy) webpage (not responsive) where I composed 4 poems, in Romanian, English, German and Spanish language;
    -Poems style are for a 'geek web developer', I arranged each final verse to be the same in each language by using the second adorable symbol in the world (after '@'), the '#';
    -Country flags are from the 'Internet'.
    
# 2.Description #

    -I used few CSS tricks/animations just for theme ambiance (poems|multi-language|fun);
    -Some advance JavaScript code are those functions where I changed the framework (mid-frame) with oter.

# 3.Tips

    -Click on '?' circle to change the UI color (click again on '?' to come back to the original).

# 4.Conclusion #

    -This project was finished with 'Cum laude' feelings, not just for the idea, but for the final result when I combined a webpage with poems and other foreign languages; it was really nice.
